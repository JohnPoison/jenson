Jenson
======

Jenson is a JSON serialization library bases on Qt's Property system and Qt's Json library.

Jenson's most interesting features are:
  - The very permissive BSD 2-clause license.
  - Only one line of code to make a QObject class (de)serializable.
  - Custom serializers can be implemented to (de)serialize to/from specific data contracts.

This library is originally developed for the finFoil project (https://github.com/hrobeers/finFoil).
